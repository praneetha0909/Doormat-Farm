## üß† **Key Insights (SQL Examples)**

```sql
-- 1. Top-Selling Meal Kit Cuisines
SELECT m.cusine_type, COUNT(m.mealkit_id) AS Total_Mealkits_Sold
FROM Spring23_S003_12_Mealkit m
JOIN Spring23_S003_12_Subscription_mealkit o2 ON m.mealkit_id = o2.mealkit_id
GROUP BY m.cusine_type
ORDER BY COUNT(m.mealkit_id) DESC;

-- 2. Ideal Warehouse Locations
SELECT c2.Address, COUNT(o1.customer_id) AS Number_Of_Orders
FROM Spring23_S003_12_Customer2 c2
JOIN Spring23_S003_12_orders1 o1 ON c2.customer_id = o1.customer_id
GROUP BY c2.Address
ORDER BY Number_Of_Orders DESC
FETCH FIRST 5 ROWS ONLY;

-- 3. Delivery Driver Performance (Average Delivery Time vs. Distance)
SELECT wd.warehouse_id, dw.worker_ssn,
AVG(CAST(((TO_DATE(Order_DeliverTS, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') - TO_DATE(Order_PickupTS, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS'))*24*60) AS DECIMAL(10,2))) AS Average_Delivery_Time,
AVG(Distance_Covered_per_order) as Mean_Distance
FROM Spring23_S003_12_warehouse_deliveryVehicle wd
JOIN Spring23_S003_12_delivery_worker1 dw ON wd.warehouse_id = dw.warehouse_id
JOIN Spring23_S003_12_Delivery_Order o ON o.Worker_SSN = dw.worker_ssn
GROUP BY wd.warehouse_id, dw.worker_ssn, Distance_Covered_per_order
ORDER BY Average_Delivery_Time ASC
FETCH FIRST 5 ROWS ONLY;
